Genomes are subject to damage by chemical and physical agents in the environment (e.g. UV and ionizing radiations, chemical mutagens, fungal and bacterial toxins, etc.) and by free radicals or alkylating agents endogenously generated in metabolism. DNA is also damaged because of errors during its replication. A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway."

comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.

def: "The process in which a solute is transported from one side of a membrane to the other." [GOC:dph, GOC:jid]
comment: Transmembrane transport requires transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
